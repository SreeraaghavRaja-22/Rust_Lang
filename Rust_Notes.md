        - makes a new directory with main.rs file in src directory
        - uninitialized git file too
    - cargo build 
        - compiles the rust file automatically
    - cargo run 
        - automatically compiles and runs the binary file 
    - cargo check 
        - checks code to make sure it compiles without making an executable file (binary file)
